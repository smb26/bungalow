# Bungalow challenge

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Libraries added:

#### Vue-awesome-swiper

this library is a wrapper for 
swiper slider (https://swiperjs.com/). I decided to use it for 3 reasons:
- it's a good slider, has good responsiveness, and it can lazy load the images, helping to optimize the main page.
- the wrapper transforms the library into a plug-and-play component, speeding up development.
- I've used it in the past and had no problems with it.
